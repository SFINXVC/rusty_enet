An idiomatic Rust reimplementation of ENet (reliable UDP library) with extra features.  
Nothing has been implemented yet :/ I just started the development.

### Planned Features
- [ ] Reliable UDP transport (core ENet functionality)
- [ ] Some additional encryption support
- [ ] Better async support for Rust ecosystem
- [ ] Customizable channel configurations
- [ ] A higher level abstraction
- [ ] More to be planned along the way
